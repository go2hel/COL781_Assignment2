This is our submission to assignment 2 for the computer graphics course COL781.

The Assignment involved coding a quadcopter that could be controlled via keyboard buttons.
This quadcopter is supposed to act as a drone camera, that would let us envision the 
scene. There was one more camera on the ground that would help us control the quadcopter.
